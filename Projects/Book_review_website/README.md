# A Book Review Website 📚

- A Book Review Website for students preparing for competitions or the general book readers also; the old readers of a book can post their reviews on this website and the new students will get help from this; I will be making the frontend of the website for now;

## Tech Stack :HTML, CSS, Javascript 🌐

## Features 🌟

The website(responsive) will display the reviews submitted by various readers on it along with the book name and reviewer's name. Any user can read the review from the website and he/she will know about the book. The website will also show the famous books trending at present or reviewed already, and much more.

## Future Scope 🔍

- This website has future scope as well; for example we can add a login page so that a user will register (or login) and then submit the review.
