# Black-Jack-Game

It is a classic casino game "Black Jack". I've used HTML, CSS and Javascript for this project. Also I've added some sound effect to make game interesting.

## Rules -

Game Rules Blackjack is a popular card game that is simple to play. The object of the game is to beat the dealer in one of the following ways:

• Get 21 points on the player's first two cards (called a "blackjack" or "natural") without a dealer blackjack;

• Reach a final score higher than the dealer without exceeding 21

• Let the dealer draw additional cards until their hand exceeds 21 ("busted").

### PS ~ Game can be played in every device/browser.
